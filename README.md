# Vehicle Interception Calculator

This is an interactive Python application for simulating a drone interception problem and a car collision problem. PySide6 is used to create the GUI with dynamic visualizations.

## Features

### Drone Intercept
- Parameters: drone speed, radar range, and reaction time
- Calculates interception possibilities for drones
- Gives suggestions for successful interception when not possible

### Car Collision
- Parameters: speeds of both cars and initial distance between them
- Calculates time until collision for two cars

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PySide6

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install PySide6`

## Usage

1. Run the application:

    `python main.py`

2. Use the tabs to switch between simulations. 

3. Adjust parameters using the spinboxes.
